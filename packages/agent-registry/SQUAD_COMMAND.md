# Squad Command Documentation

## Overview

The `squad` command is a CLI tool for managing custom agent squads with Pokemon-style configuration. It provides both interactive and command-line interfaces for creating, managing, and launching agent teams based on open-swe patterns.

## Installation

```bash
#  The squad command is part of the open-composer CLI
bun add @open-composer/agent-registry

# Or install globally
bun install -g @open-composer/agent-registry
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Start interactive mode (recommended for beginners)
open-composer squad interactive

# Create a quick open-composer squad for a specific task
open-composer squad quick programmer --name "Code Squad" --launch

# List all available agents
open-composer squad list-agents

# View registry statistics
open-composer squad stats
```

## Commands

## Advanced Usage

### Programmatic API

```typescript
import {
  getAgentRegistry,
  getSquadLauncher,
  LLMTask,
} from "@open-composer/agent-registry";

// Get registry instance
const registry = getAgentRegistry();

// Get agents by task
const programmers = registry.getAgentsByTask(LLMTask.PROGRAMMER);

// Create open-composer squad launcher
const launcher = getSquadLauncher();

// Create quick squad
const team = launcher.createQuickSquad(LLMTask.PROGRAMMER, "My Squad");

// Launch squad
const results = await launcher.launchSquad(team.id, {
  task: LLMTask.PROGRAMMER,
  priority: 1,
});
```

### Custom Squad Configuration

```typescript
import { getAgentRegistry } from "@open-composer/agent-registry";

const registry = getAgentRegistry();

const open-composer squad = registry.createSquad({
  name: "Custom Squad",
  description: "Specialized configuration",
  agentIds: ["agent-1", "agent-2", "agent-3"],
  taskDistribution: "specialized",
  maxConcurrent: 3,
  fallbackEnabled: true,
});
```

## Pokemon-Style Features

### Agent Stats

Each agent has Pokemon-style stats (0-100 scale):

- **Speed**: Response latency and execution speed
- **Accuracy**: Precision and correctness
- **Power**: Capability for complex tasks
- **Efficiency**: Token usage and resource optimization
- **Versatility**: Multi-task adaptability

### Evolution System

Agents can evolve based on model hierarchy:

```
Haiku ‚Üí Sonnet ‚Üí Opus (Anthropic)
Nano ‚Üí Mini ‚Üí GPT-5 (OpenAI)
Flash ‚Üí Pro (Google)
```

### Type System

Agents have types based on specializations:

- üß≠ Strategic (Planner)
- ‚ö° Electric (Programmer)
- üîç Psychic (Reviewer)
- üåä Water (Router)
- üåø Grass (Summarizer)
- üåü Normal (Multi-type)

## Performance Tracking

The system tracks agent performance:

```typescript
// Automatic tracking on open-composer squad execution
const results = await launcher.launchSquad(teamId, context);

// View performance stats
const agent = registry.getAgent(agentId);
console.log(agent.performance);
// {
//   totalTokensUsed: 10000,
//   totalRequests: 50,
//   successRate: 95.5,
//   averageLatency: 250
// }
```

## Integration with Open SWE

The open-composer squad command integrates with open-swe patterns:

### Model Configuration
```typescript
// Uses TASK_TO_CONFIG_DEFAULTS_MAP
const config = {
  [LLMTask.PROGRAMMER]: {
    modelName: "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-0",
    temperature: 0,
  },
};
```

### Provider System
```typescript
// Uses PROVIDER_FALLBACK_ORDER
const providers = ["openai", "anthropic", "google-genai"];
```

### Task Assignment
```typescript
// Follows LLMTask enum patterns
enum LLMTask {
  PLANNER = "planner",
  PROGRAMMER = "programmer",
  REVIEWER = "reviewer",
  ROUTER = "router",
  SUMMARIZER = "summarizer",
}
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Quick Development Squad

```bash
# Create and launch a programming squad
open-composer squad quick programmer --name "Dev Team" --launch
```

### Example 2: Custom Review Team

```bash
# Start interactive mode
open-composer squad interactive

# Then select:
# 1. Build Custom Squad
# 2. Select reviewer agents
# 3. Choose specialized distribution
# 4. Set max concurrent to 2
```

### Example 3: Compare Providers

```bash
# List agents by provider
open-composer squad list-agents --provider anthropic
open-composer squad list-agents --provider openai

# Compare specific agents
open-composer squad compare <anthropic-agent-id> <openai-agent-id>
```

### Example 4: Performance Analysis

```bash
# View stats before
open-composer squad stats

# Launch squad
open-composer squad launch <squad-id> programmer

# View stats after
open-composer squad stats
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Agent not found
```bash
# Solution: List all agents to find correct ID
open-composer squad list-agents
```

**Issue**: Squad launch fails
```bash
# Solution: Check open-composer squad configuration
open-composer squad list-squads

# Verify agents can handle the task
open-composer squad show <agent-id>
```

**Issue**: No agents for task
```bash
# Solution: Check available agents for task
open-composer squad list-agents --task programmer
```

## Tips & Best Practices

1. **Use Interactive Mode** for complex open-composer squad configurations
2. **Quick Squads** are great for rapid prototyping
3. **Compare Agents** before creating custom squads
4. **Monitor Performance** using registry stats
5. **Use Specialized Distribution** for critical tasks
6. **Use Balanced Distribution** for unknown workloads
7. **Enable Fallback** for production reliability
