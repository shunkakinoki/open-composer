# CLI Version Fix Summary

## Problem
The CLI_VERSION was returning 0.0.0 in bin bundles and npm installations instead of the correct version from package.json.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Broken version generation script**: `apps/cli/scripts/generate-version.ts` was using `import.meta.dir` which is not available in Node.js, causing the script to fail when run with Node.js instead of Bun.

2. **Inefficient version loading**: `apps/cli/src/lib/version.ts` was trying to read the generated version file at runtime using `readFileSync`, which doesn't work reliably in bundled contexts.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Version Generation Script (`apps/cli/scripts/generate-version.ts`)
- **Before**: Used `import.meta.dir` and `Bun.write()` which are Bun-specific
- **After**: Used Node.js compatible `fileURLToPath`, `dirname`, and `writeFileSync`
- **Result**: Script now works with both Node.js and Bun

### 2. Simplified Version Loading (`apps/cli/src/lib/version.ts`)
- **Before**: Complex runtime file reading with fallbacks
- **After**: Direct ES module import of generated version file
- **Result**: More reliable and simpler version loading

## Files Changed
1. `apps/cli/scripts/generate-version.ts` - Fixed Node.js compatibility
2. `apps/cli/src/lib/version.ts` - Simplified to direct import approach

## Test Coverage Added
1. `tests/lib/version.test.ts` - Tests CLI_VERSION export and consistency
2. `tests/scripts/generate-version.test.ts` - Tests version generation script
3. `tests/components/version-display.test.tsx` - Tests version usage in components
4. `tests/build/version-integration.test.ts` - Tests build process integration

## Verification
- ✅ Bundled JavaScript now shows correct version (0.8.11) instead of 0.0.0
- ✅ Platform-specific binaries show correct version
- ✅ Build process works correctly with both `bun run build` and `bun run scripts/prepublish.ts`
- ✅ Version generation creates proper `version.generated.ts` file
- ✅ All tests pass (14 tests across 4 test files)

## Impact
- CLI version is now correctly displayed in all contexts
- Version is properly embedded in both bundled JS and compiled binaries
- Build process is more reliable and works with both Node.js and Bun
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures the fix is maintained
